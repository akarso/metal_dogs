# Upstream pin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream remote | `upstream` → `https://github.com/akarso/shopanda.git` |
| Origin (this product) | `origin` → `git@github.com:akarso/metal_dogs.git` (HTTPS clone URL: `https://github.com/akarso/metal_dogs.git`) |
| Branch policy | **main-only** (no Metal Dogs `dev` branch; do not run upstream `scripts/promote-dev-to-main.sh` here) |
| Pinned ref | commit SHA (Shopanda has no release tags yet) |
| Pinned commit | `a8cbcb18c5054178ba5e5f0e4980f82b0a7ed512` |
| Pinned subject | Merge pull request #571 from akarso/pr-570-media-harden-followup |
| Verified locally | 2026-11-08 (absorb #568 + #570 + #571; explicit `upstream/dev` tip — not yet on `upstream/main`) |

Upgrade procedure: [`runbooks/shopanda-upgrade.md`](runbooks/shopanda-upgrade.md).

Metal Dogs owns product documentation under `docs/` (roadmap, ADRs, architecture, runbooks). Upstream Shopanda guides/diagrams/phase history are **not** vendored as full trees; stubs under `docs/guides/` and `docs/diagrams/` point at this pin on GitHub. Inherited fail-closed artefacts kept in-tree: `docs/GOVULN_BASELINE.md`, `docs/COMMERCIAL.md`.

Before merging a newer `upstream` tip: ensure this clone is not shallow (`test ! -f .git/shallow`). If it is, `git fetch --unshallow upstream` first.
